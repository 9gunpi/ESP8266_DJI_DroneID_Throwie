H.A.R.D. - Hackers Against Remote DroneID
* use a throwie for anonymity! Make yourself a needle in a haystack.
* copy and rebroadcast someone else's valid ID?
* create a 'vanity swarm' around your aircraft, or location for lulz! #Skypeen #AirDicks
* generate arbitrary flight path trails to form polygons
* create randomized fuckery for Remote Drone ID receiver operators (such as DJI AeroScope users)
* test your own Remote Drone Identification technology for flawed logic.
